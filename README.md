    - List of studies from [our previous work](https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/217234254/PosterPaper_ICSA23_IFatima_CameraReady.pdf) consisting of a systematic literature review which is used for extraction of SA evaluation inputs, outputs, and steps.
    - Identified steps of evaluation for each study. For studies that did not provide any information on the steps they followed, we mark their steps as NA (Not Available).
    - Color-coded steps based on the function they perform and similarities with other steps. These steps are further used to create activity diagrams per method (available as steps.png). Methods that have identical steps are grouped together and represented by a single activity diagram.  The activity diagram contains a legend for color codes.
