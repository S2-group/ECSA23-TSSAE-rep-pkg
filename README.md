<!-- ## Quick start
Here a documentation on how to use the replication material should be provided.

### Getting started

1. Provide step-by-step instruction on how to use this repository, including requirements, and installation / script execution steps.

2. Code snippets should be formatted as follows.
   - `git clone https://github.com/S2-group/template-replication-package`

3. Links to specific folders / files of the repository can be linked in Markdown, for example this is a link to the [src](src/) folder.

## Repository Structure
This is the root directory of the repository. The directory is structured as follows: -->

    <!-- template-replication-package
     .     |
     |--- data/                            Data used in the thesis / paper
            |
            |--- additional_subfolder/     Subfolders should be further nested to increase readability                 
   -->

* a [data](data/) folder contains
  - data.xlsx: The file contains
    - List of studies from [our previous work](https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/217234254/PosterPaper_ICSA23_IFatima_CameraReady.pdf) consisting of a systematic literature review which is used for extraction of SA evaluation inputs, outputs, and steps.
    - Identified steps of evaluation for each study. For studies that did not provide any information on the steps they followed, we mark their steps as NA (Not Available).
    - Color-coded steps based on the function they perform and similarities with other steps. These steps are further used to create activity diagrams per method (available as steps.png). Methods that have identical steps are grouped together and represented by a single activity diagram.  The activity diagram contains a legend for color codes.
